## The Code 

After exploring thoroughly the literacy dataset from UNICEF. I found out that there are countries that don't have any value in performing stratified imputation. There are 6 countries that do not have any literacy-related data. In addition, their economic statuses are labeled as 'not classified'. When I performed the stratified imputation based on the economic status of countries, these 6 countries stood out as a separate group. The problem is there is no data to impute. For now, I added them back to the dataset along with other imputed strata.

## Best Understanding

### Imputation 

In order to impute the missing values, we need to identify how many missing values are there and whether are they missing at random. The problem is there are rows where all the data are missing as a whole. In addition, the data are not missing at random, and removing them from the dataset completely will certainly introduce certain biases. 

On the other hand, imputing directly as a column will introduce outliers because the dataset contains developed countries that have high literacy rates and least developed countries which have low literacy rates. If we substitute the mean/median that is calculated based on these variables for the missing values will certainly introduce biases to the dataset. 

Therefore, I will divide the countries into different groups based on their economic status <b>('Development Regions' in the dataset)</b>. This process can reduce the number of biases because the imputation of mean or median would take in each group. For example, a certain developed country variable which can become the outlier will not affect other groups. This process of dividing the dataset into different groups based on certain characteristics and performing imputation is called <b>"Stratified Imputation"</b>.

##### Definition: Stratified imputation involves dividing the data into strata (e.g., by region, income group, or development status) and imputing missing values within each stratum separately. This approach helps account for differences in literacy rates across different groups and reduces bias.

## Best Efforts

  If this is your code and it has a bug, explain what you've tried so far:

  - Include code
  - Mention everything you tried, even if it seems silly to you
  - What happened with each effort?
  - What brought you closer?
  - What brought you farther?

Among the different imputation methods, I would like to choose the median value to impute the null values a.k.a "NAN". Replacing null values with the mean or median of a certain column is very popular in imputation. "The technique, in this instance, replaces the null values with mean, rounded mean, or median values determined for that feature across the whole dataset (in our case, in each group). It is advised to utilize the median rather than the mean when your dataset has a significant number of outliers (Simplilearn, 2023)." For the 6 countries that I could not do any imputation methods, I added them back to the dataset as their original null values.
