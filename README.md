### Overview

This project is dedicated to improving the quality of education in developing nations by identifying key factors contributing to low literacy rates. The literacy rate is defined as the total number of literate individuals in a specific age group, expressed as a percentage of the total population within that age bracket. Two essential metrics, the adult literacy rate (measuring literacy among individuals aged 15 years and older) and the youth literacy rate (measuring literacy among those aged 15 to 24 years), provide nuanced insights into educational achievements.

The literacy rate serves as a crucial indicator of educational attainment and socioeconomic development. Through comprehensive data exploration, this project delves into the intricate factors influencing low literacy rates. The objective is to uncover these determinants, paving the way for the development of targeted interventions and policies. By addressing the root causes, the project aims to promote educational advancement in developing countries.

### Problem Statement:

Despite the global recognition of the importance of literacy in fostering educational attainment and socioeconomic development, many developing nations continue to grapple with persistently low literacy rates. This project identifies a critical need to address the complex factors contributing to these challenges. The problem at hand lies in understanding the nuanced determinants of low literacy rates within the education domain of developing countries, hindering the overall quality of education in these regions.

### Research question:

What major contributors influence the low literacy rate in developing countries within the domain of education?

### Objective:

To pinpoint the major contributors to the quality of education and literacy rates in developing countries and delineate significant steps for enhancing educational standards.

### Project's Data :

For our project, we extensively utilize the UNICEF dataset on education, covering a wide spectrum of education levels, ranging from pre-primary education to youth and adult education. This dataset places a strong emphasis on measuring learning outcomes, skills acquisition, and ensuring equity in educational contexts. It is designed to address the nuances of both developmental and emergency settings.More information about the dataset can be found

# Project Overview

This project is organized into several phases, each crucial for its successful completion.

### 1. Collaborative Development (January 8 - 19)

During this phase, the team members get to know each other and establish effective collaboration. We build our collaboration plan, set norms, define learning goals, and specify project constraints. You can find more details about each deliverable in the corresponding documents linked below:

### 2. Problem Identification (January 22 - 26)

During this week, we engaged in multiple brainstorming sessions to identify and select the problem we aim to address with our project. The process involved the following steps:

- **Divergent Thinking:** We began with divergent thinking, generating a wide range of ideas and potential problem areas related to our project scope.

- **Narrowing Focus:** Next, we narrowed down our focus by evaluating and refining the ideas generated in the divergent thinking phase. We considered various domains and specific problems until we arrived at the final problem statement.

- **Main Problems Identification:** We systematically identified the main problems or challenges that our project aims to tackle. This step involved prioritizing issues based on their relevance, impact, and feasibility.

- **Context Analysis:** To ensure a thorough understanding of the problem, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the context surrounding it. This analysis included gathering relevant information, studying existing solutions or approaches, and assessing the needs of potential stakeholders.

Through these efforts, we laid the groundwork for our project by defining a clear problem statement and gaining insights into the context in which it exists.

### 3. Data Collection (January 29 - February 2)

During this phase, our focus was on gathering relevant data sets that are pertinent to addressing the identified problem. The process involved the following steps:

- **Exploring Available Data Sets:** We conducted an extensive exploration of various available data sets to identify those that align closely with the problem statement defined in the previous phase.

- **Series of Searches:** Through a series of searches and evaluations, we assessed the suitability and relevance of different data sources. This involved considering factors such as data quality, coverage, and compatibility with our project objectives.

- **Selection of Data Source:** After careful deliberation, we reached a consensus to utilize the UNICEF data set as it provides valuable insights and information relevant to our project goals. The decision to use this particular data set was based on its comprehensiveness, reliability, and alignment with our project requirements.

- **Cleaning the Dataset:** Upon selecting the suitable data set, we proceeded to clean the data to ensure its quality and usability for analysis. This involved identifying and addressing any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the data, ensuring that it is accurate and reliable for further processing.

By selecting the UNICEF data set and cleaning it meticulously, we ensured access to robust and relevant data that will facilitate our analysis and contribute to the effectiveness of our project outcomes.

One of the main issues with the original data which we have noticed is missing values,especially for least developed countries and less developed countries.
Those missing cells had been filled with median of their respective category.

## 4. Data Analysis (February 5 - 16)
In this phase, we analyze the collected data to derive insights and draw conclusions. We use various analytical techniques and tools to make sense of the data and identify patterns or trends.
