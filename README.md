### Overview

This project is dedicated to improving the quality of education in developing nations by identifying key factors contributing to low literacy rates. The literacy rate is defined as the total number of literate individuals in a specific age group, expressed as a percentage of the total population within that age bracket. Two essential metrics, the adult literacy rate (measuring literacy among individuals aged 15 years and older) and the youth literacy rate (measuring literacy among those aged 15 to 24 years), provide nuanced insights into educational achievements.

The literacy rate serves as a crucial indicator of educational attainment and socioeconomic development. Through comprehensive data exploration, this project delves into the intricate factors influencing low literacy rates. The objective is to uncover these determinants, paving the way for the development of targeted interventions and policies. By addressing the root causes, the project aims to promote educational advancement in developing countries.

### Problem Statement:


233
To Find the major contributors to the quality of education and literacy rate in developing countries. What major steps shall be taken to improve quality of education in those countries?

Despite the global recognition of the importance of literacy in fostering educational attainment and socioeconomic development, many developing nations continue to grapple with persistently low literacy rates. This project identifies a critical need to address the complex factors contributing to these challenges. The problem at hand lies in understanding the nuanced determinants of low literacy rates within the education domain of developing countries, hindering the overall quality of education in these regions.

### Research question:


What major contributors influence the low literacy rate in developing countries within the domain of education?

### Objective:

To pinpoint the major contributors to the quality of education and literacy rates in developing countries and delineate significant steps for enhancing educational standards.

### Project's Data :

For our project, we extensively utilize the UNICEF dataset on education, covering a wide spectrum of education levels, ranging from pre-primary education to youth and adult education. This dataset places a strong emphasis on measuring learning outcomes, skills acquisition, and ensuring equity in educational contexts. It is designed to address the nuances of both developmental and emergency settings.More information about the dataset can be found

## Data cleaning 

Upon selecting the suitable data set, we proceeded to clean the data to ensure its quality and usability for analysis. This involved identifying and addressing any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the data, ensuring that it is accurate and reliable for further processing. One of the main issues with the original data which we have noticed is missing values,especially for least developed countries and less developed countries. Those missing cells had been filled with median of their respective category.

By selecting the UNICEF data set and cleaning it meticulously, we ensured access to robust and relevant data that will facilitate our analysis and contribute to the effectiveness of our project outcomes.

## Data Analysis
In this phase, we analyze the collected data to derive insights and draw conclusions. We use various analytical techniques and tools to make sense of the data and identify patterns or trends.
