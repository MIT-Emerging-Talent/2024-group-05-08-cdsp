## Findings



#### Global Disparities:\*

- Considerable variation in literacy rates exists among developing countries, with some nations showing rates approaching 90%, while others, particularly in Africa, exhibit significantly lower literacy rates.

#### Gender Disparities:\*

- A noticeable gender disparity in literacy rates, particularly in adult literacy, highlights lower rates for females. This suggests gender-based barriers to education in several developing countries.

#### Wealth Disparities:\*

- Economic status correlates with educational outcomes, with countries categorized as 'Least Developed' often showing lower literacy rates. Targeted interventions are crucial to address educational inequalities among different wealth categories.

#### Educational Progression:\*

- Completion rates decline as education progresses from primary to upper secondary. Females consistently exhibit higher completion rates, emphasizing gender-specific factors influencing educational progression.

#### Out-of-School Rates:\*

- Rural areas experience higher out-of-school rates compared to urban areas, and individuals from economically disadvantaged backgrounds show the highest rates. This underscores the need for targeted policies to address disparities in educational access.

#### Correlation:\*

- Positive correlations exist between completion rates and literacy rates, suggesting that higher completion rates are associated with higher literacy rates. Females tend to achieve higher literacy rates, indicating potential gender-based advantages.

#### Call to Action:\*

- Efforts should focus on reducing gender disparities, addressing economic inequalities, and implementing targeted interventions for vulnerable populations. Policymakers and educators can use these findings to allocate resources effectively and design inclusive educational reforms.
