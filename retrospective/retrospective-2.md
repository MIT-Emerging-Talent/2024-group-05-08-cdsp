## Stop Doing:

- Assigning single task to multiple people.
- Pushing the code without reviewing by other teammates

## Continue Doing:

- For data cleaning, assign a task for two people. One which is good in technical terms and the other in documentation.
- Taking into account everyone's opinion, it helped us a lot, For instance the idea of dividing the regions into sub-regions came from one of our team members Thomas. This helped us a lot in filling the missing values.
- Using project board as a main resource for bringing the changes to repository.

## Start Doing:

- Having more meetings with Evan and group teammates.
- Using the project board as our main point of connection for reviewing each others work.

## Lessons Learned:
- Give more importance to project board.
- Everyone's opinion matters, sometimes it can solve the problem that everyone is facing, but no one is talking about.
