## Stop Doing:

- Assigning single task to multiple people.
- Pushing the code without reviewing.

## Continue Doing:

- For data cleaning, assign a task for two people. One which is good in technical terms and the other in documentation.
- Taking into account everyone's opinion, it helped us a lot, For instance the idea of dividing the regions into sub-regions came from one of our team members Thomas. This helped us a lot in filling the missing values.

## Start Doing:

- Having more meetings with Evan and group teammates.

## Lessons Learned:

- How to clean the data.
