# Milestone 1: Problem Identification

During this week, our team engaged in extensive brainstorming sessions to determine our research domain and identify the primary problem we aim to address. The following summarizes our activities and outcomes:

## Brainstorming Sessions:
- Conducted multiple brainstorming sessions to explore various research domains and potential problems.
- Encouraged open discussion and idea generation among team members to foster creativity and collaboration.

## Research Domain Selection:
- After thorough deliberation and analysis, we narrowed down our focus to specific research domains.
- Considered factors such as relevance, feasibility, and potential impact in selecting the research domain.

## Identified Research Questions:
- Generated a list of research questions to guide our investigation and problem-solving process.
- Some of the questions we considered include:
  - Analyzing the Impact of Socioeconomic Factors on Academic Achievement
  - What are the basic needs to improve an education system?
  - What causes gender inequality in education?
  - How should governments improve the quality of education?

  - What are the main causes of differences in access to high-quality education and educational inequality?
  - How does education relate to the success of a nation?
