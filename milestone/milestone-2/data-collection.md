### Data collection-Deliverables

#### Data set

For our project, we are utilizing the UNICEF dataset on education, which encompasses a range of education levels, spanning from pre-primary education to youth and adult education. This dataset places a strong emphasis on measuring learning outcomes, acquiring skills, and ensuring equity in educational contexts, including both developmental and emergency settings.

The UNICEF education dataset comprises different subsets, covering indicators like out-of-school rate, adjusted net attendance rate, completion rate, foundational learning skills, information communication technology skills, youth and adult literacy rate, as well as school-age digital connectivity.
