# Project Overview

This project is organized into several phases, each crucial for its successful completion.

### 1. Collaborative Development (January 8 - 19)

During this phase, the team members get to know each other and establish effective collaboration. We build our collaboration plan, set norms, define learning goals, and specify project constraints. You can find more details about each deliverable in the corresponding documents linked below:

### 2. Problem Identification (January 22 - 26)

During this week, we engaged in multiple brainstorming sessions to identify and select the problem we aim to address with our project. The process involved the following steps:

- **Divergent Thinking:** We began with divergent thinking, generating a wide range of ideas and potential problem areas related to our project scope.

- **Narrowing Focus:** Next, we narrowed down our focus by evaluating and refining the ideas generated in the divergent thinking phase. We considered various domains and specific problems until we arrived at the final problem statement.

- **Main Problems Identification:** We systematically identified the main problems or challenges that our project aims to tackle. This step involved prioritizing issues based on their relevance, impact, and feasibility.

- **Context Analysis:** To ensure a thorough understanding of the problem, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the context surrounding it. This analysis included gathering relevant information, studying existing solutions or approaches, and assessing the needs of potential stakeholders.

Through these efforts, we laid the groundwork for our project by defining a clear problem statement and gaining insights into the context in which it exists.

### 3. Data Collection (January 29 - February 2)

During this phase, our focus was on gathering relevant data sets that are pertinent to addressing the identified problem. The process involved the following steps:

- **Exploring Available Data Sets:** We conducted an extensive exploration of various available data sets to identify those that align closely with the problem statement defined in the previous phase.

- **Series of Searches:** Through a series of searches and evaluations, we assessed the suitability and relevance of different data sources. This involved considering factors such as data quality, coverage, and compatibility with our project objectives.

- **Selection of Data Source:** After careful deliberation, we reached a consensus to utilize the UNICEF data set as it provides valuable insights and information relevant to our project goals. The decision to use this particular data set was based on its comprehensiveness, reliability, and alignment with our project requirements.

- **Cleaning the Dataset:** Upon selecting the suitable data set, we proceeded to clean the data to ensure its quality and usability for analysis. This involved identifying and addressing any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the data, ensuring that it is accurate and reliable for further processing.
One of the main issues with the original data which we have noticed is missing values,especially for least developed countries and less developed countries.
Those missing cells had been filled with median of their respective category.
By selecting the UNICEF data set and cleaning it meticulously, we ensured access to robust and relevant data that will facilitate our analysis and contribute to the effectiveness of our project outcomes.

## 4. Data Analysis (February 5 - 16)
In this phase, we analyze the collected data to derive insights and draw conclusions. We use various analytical techniques and tools to make sense of the data and identify patterns or trends.
