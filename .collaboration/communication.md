## Group Rules

1.  Branching Protocol:

    . Start by initiating pull requests to synchronize with changes from the remote repository.

    . Create dedicated feature branches for introducing new functionalities or addressing bugs.

2.  Coding Style:

    . Establish and adhere to a consistent code style, such as PEP 8 for Python.

    . Employ linters and automated formatting tools to ensure code conforms to the established style.

    . Maintain consistency in documentation format.

4.  Code Review Practices:

    . Require code reviews before merging branches.
    
    . Offer constructive feedback during reviews.
    
    . Utilize available code review tools and integrations.

6.  Issue Management:

    . Use GitHub Issues or a similar system to track bugs, features, and tasks.

    . Clearly define issue templates and apply labels appropriately.

7.  Pull Request Protocol:

    . Clearly outline the purpose of pull requests.

    . Ensure all tests pass before merging changes.

8.  Version Control Practices:

## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 30 min_: Try on your own
2. _30 -> 60 min_: Ask your group for help
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
